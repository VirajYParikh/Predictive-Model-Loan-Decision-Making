## 1. INTRODUCTION
### a. Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the creditworthiness of loan applications to maximize profitability within a specific budget the bank has which can be given as loans. This will be achieved through the development of a highly accurate predictive model capable of thoroughly assessing the credit risk associated with potential borrowers in various lending institutions. The project entails a comprehensive analysis of customer financial data, credit history, employment details, and loan repayment records, all of which will contribute to the construction of a robust credit risk assessment model. Ultimately, the aim is to make well-informed loan decisions that not only mitigate risks but also maximize profitability for the lending institution.

### b. Plan of action:
The loan approval process involves a comprehensive evaluation of various factors to assess the suitability of a customer's loan application. These factors include the customer's credit score, age, loan type, loan amount, and other relevant information. By carefully considering these factors, we assign a credit risk value to each customer within a range of 0 to 1. Our aim is to train a robust model using a comprehensive dataset that incorporates all these features. Through this training, we seek to develop an accurate credit risk assessment model that can effectively evaluate and rate the risk associated with each customer. This model will provide lending institutions with valuable insights to make well-informed loan decisions. By leveraging customer financial data, credit history, employment information, and loan repayment history, we strive to optimize the loan approval process while safeguarding the institution's financial interests. Ultimately, our goal is to strike a balance between approving viable loan applications and ensuring the lending institution's profitability and sustainability.

Following are the steps weâ€™ll follow:

**Step 1**: Extract data.

**Step 2**: Clean the data.

**Step 3**: Analyze the data.

**Step 4**: Feature selection.

**Step 5**: Train and test different models.

**Step 6**: Implement the business requirements on the best model. 

**Step 7**: Repeat from step 5.
